In Peppermint Rush you have to collect **peppermint leaves** from 35 pots, trying to achieve the highest score possible. Oh, and must prepare the soil and plant the shoots too.

To do this, there are 4 tools at your disposal that you can select by clicking the corresponding button, or using special keys (ASZX or 1234). After the plant is fully grown chop it 3 times, each time will grant you 1 point.

But be swift! If you leave a pot unattended for some time (10 seconds) it will die, and you won't be able to use it anymore. The time shortens every time a pot die, so try to avoid this. Don't worry, there's a safeguard: if a pot dies, no other can do it for 3 seconds.

Use the pause button ( _space bar_ ) to give your hands a rest.

Good luck, have fun.
