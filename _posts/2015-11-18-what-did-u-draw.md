I've been watching [its video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nntGTK2Fhb0) with my daughter a lot and from time to time i paused it to watch a random picture. I've found some really funny and/or creative paintings, and I thought it would be cool to be able to see every picture separately.

I've used *ffmpeg* to extract all the frames and a custom uploader made with *Coffee Script* / *Node.js* to upload the painted ones to a [Tumblr blog](http://whatdidudraw.tumblr.com) which uses a custom theme I've made.
