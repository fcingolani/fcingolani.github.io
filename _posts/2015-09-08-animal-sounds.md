## About

I've made this game (or should I say _toy_?) to play with my toddler, and she really liked it! I thought some other kids may like it too, so I decided to share it for free.

## Game modes

I use this _toy_ in 3 different ways. You can come up with new ones too!

### Smash for sounds

Toddlers will love touching the screen to hear the sounds and watch animations.

### Choose and Match

Select an animal and challenge the child to pick another one of the same type.

### Challenge

Pick as many matching animals as you can and check the number (i.e. 3 pandas). Then let the child do the same with a different animal (i.e. 5 elephants). The highest number wins the round!
